# ai_algos
Implementation of core some AI algorithms in some languages.

This is purely for learning/ education purposes. As such, all algorithms are written using only the core library.

## Organisation
This repo is organised by algorithm, and then by programming language. Any markup related overview of an algorithm is at the algorithm directory level in a file called `algo.md`, any language specific notes for an algorithm are at the programming language directory level, called `lang.md`
